Responsible AI for Samsung Product Launch Planner
===============================================

This document summarizes three core Responsible AI principles integrated into the Product Launch Planner.

1. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
----------------------------------
Why it’s suitable

All agents deal with data about customers, markets, or competitors. If the system learns from biased or incomplete data, it could make unfair or misleading decisions.

Application by agent
Agent | How Fairness applies
---|---
Market Analyzer | Ensure equal market consideration across regions — not only promoting high-income or urban areas.
Customer Segmentation Agent | Avoid grouping customers unfairly (e.g., not segmenting based on gender or ethnicity unless relevant).
Campaign Agent | Make sure advertising reach and budget are distributed fairly among segments.
Competitor Agent | Analyze all competitors objectively without favoring specific brands or data sources.

2. Transparency and Explainability
---------------------------------
Why it’s suitable

Managers and marketing teams must understand why the system made a particular prediction or suggestion (e.g., why launch in December or target Segment B).

Application by agent
Agent | How Transparency applies
---|---
Market Analyzer | Clearly explain factors behind demand forecasts or trend predictions.
Customer Segmentation Agent | Show the key features used to form each segment.
Campaign Agent | Display reasoning behind campaign timing or channel choices.
Competitor Agent | Provide transparent logic for competitor ranking or threat level.

3. Accountability and Human Oversight
-----------------------------------
Why it’s suitable

Launch decisions have major business impact — humans must approve or adjust AI outputs.

Application by agent
Agent | How Accountability applies
---|---
Market Analyzer | Human marketing analysts verify predictions before use.
Customer Segmentation Agent | Marketing leads approve segment definitions before campaigns run.
Campaign Agent | Campaign managers finalize plans; AI only assists.
Competitor Agent | Analysts review and confirm competitor insights before acting.

Implementation notes
- Surface explainability artifacts in the UI near each agent output (feature importance, confidence scores, provenance).
- Provide an audit log for agent suggestions and human actions.
- Add an approval workflow for campaign execution that requires explicit human sign-off.
